RestfulWorkflow
===============

This plugin provides interview-style workflow in a controller, similar to 
TurboTax, but without the need to save models to the database immediately.
All data is stored in the session unless overridden.

Using this DSL implements the 'show' and 'update' actions in your controller,
so please do not override those unless you wish to break the workflow.  When
rendering, each step will look for a template of the same name.

Example
=======

class InterviewController < ApplicationController

  stage do |steps|
    steps.start do
      data do
        column :first_name, :type => :string
        validates_presence_of :first_name
      end
    end
    
    steps.contact_info do
      before { @name = self.class.find_step('start').load_data(self).first_name }
      data do
        column :email, :type => :string
        column :accept, :type => :boolean
        validates_acceptance_of :accept
      end
      forward "/profile"
    end
  end

end
